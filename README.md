# Automated-ATM-Emulator
A Python-based ATM simulation featuring secure PIN registration, authentication logic, and transaction management.

# Key Features
* **Secure Registration**: Allows users to create a unique 4-digit PIN.
* **Input Validation:** Uses `.isdigit()` and length checks to ensure PINs are exactly 4 numbers.
* **Authentication System:** A secure login loop that grants or denies access based on the registered PIN.

# Technical Skills Demonstrated
* **Functional Programming:** Organized logic into reusable functions like `register_Pin()` and `login_pin()`.
* **User Input Handling:** Capturing and sanitizing data from the terminal.
* **Conditional Logic:** Implementing complex `if/else` flows for security checks.

# How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `python ATM.py` in your terminal.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to register and log in.
